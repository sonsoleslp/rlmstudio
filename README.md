## Installation

You can install the development version of \`rlmstudio\`\` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sonsoleslp/rlmstudio")
```

## Example

Load the library

``` r
library("rlmstudio")
```

Donâ€™t forget to have your LM studio server running!

Ask for a single response

``` r
prompt_lm("Tell me a joke!")
```

    #> [1] "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

Iterate through a dataframe using the same prompt with variable input

``` r
countries = data.frame(Country = c("Spain", "Finland", "Egypt", "Sweden")) %>%
  rowwise %>% mutate(Capital = prompt_lm(paste0("What is the capital of ", Country, "?")))
countries
```

    #>   Country   Capital
    #> 1   Spain    Madrid
    #> 2 Finland  Helsinki
    #> 3   Egypt     Cairo
    #> 4  Sweden Stockholm
